# MDCN
This is the code for our paper `Multi-angle Joint Distance Network for Combinatorial Medication Recommendation`.

For replication of the drug recommendation outcomes reported in this paper, please refer to the guidelines below.

# overview

We have modularized and encapsulated the code to enhance its readability and maintainability. In summary, the MDCN can be split into two core components: the feature extractor and the prediction head. The feature extractor primarily captures multi-dimensional clinical feature representations of patients, while the prediction head computes the classification probability for each medical condition label.
